## Legal constraints 

### Rest between shifts
It's mandatory that the employee has a rest of at least 12 hours between the end of a shift and the start of a new one.

### Rotations 
TODO: describe the legal? case where employees rotate day/night shifts and where it's applicable

### Rotations  knowledge
Here is a real world example from a company which works on providing Technical support.
In this company there are shifts which are 4,6,8 hours. The people in this company 
who are not full time(working 6 or 4 hours) have almost fixed working time, however
the people who are working for 8 hours are in a team led by a manager. Their worktime
is dynamic and it is determined by other people working time in the Rotation.

How does the rotation work in such a team: There are fixed time slots for every 2 weeks
and the manager's goal is to put every one at least once through each slot, meaning that 
a lot of people will rotate to work on a time time slot. For example if we have a team
of 20 people and the time slot is from 8AM to 5PM in a 2 weeks span the manager will try
to put each and ever one of them to work a day in this slot(if possible).

Essentially we can say that there exists a group of people which rotate fixed positions
in a time interval and once the rotation is done it is repeated. This creates the dependency that 
the schedule of the person is determined by the other people's previous time schedule slots
they have been working with.
